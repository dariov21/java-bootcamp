/*
 * Write a superclass called Shape (as shown in the class diagram), which contains:
Two instance variables color (String) and filled (boolean).
Two constructors: 
-a no-arg (no-argument) constructor that initializes the color to "green" and filled to true,
- a constructor that initializes the color and filled to the given values.
-Getter and setter for all the instance variables. 
	By convention, the getter for a boolean variable xxx is called isXXX() 
	(instead of getXxx() for all the other types).
-A toString() method that returns "A Shape with color of xxx and filled/Not filled".
-----
Write a test program to test all the methods defined in Shape.
