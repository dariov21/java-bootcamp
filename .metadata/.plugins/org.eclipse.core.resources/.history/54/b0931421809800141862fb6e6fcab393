package authorAndBookPackage;
/*Four private instance variables: name (String), 
 * author (of the class Author you have just created, assume that each book has one and only one author), 
 * price (double), and qtyInStock (int);
Two constructors:
public Book (String name, Author author, double price) {...}
public Book (String name, Author author, double price, 
     int qtyInStock) {...}
public methods getName(), getAuthor(), getPrice(), setPrice(), getQtyInStock(), setQtyInStock().
toString() that returns "'book-name' by author-name (gender) at email".
(Take note that the Author's toString() method returns "author-name (gender) at email".)
Write the class Book (which uses the Author class written earlier). Also write a test program called TestBook
 to test the constructor and public methods in the class Book. Take Note that you have to construct an instance of Author before you can construct an instance of Book. E.g.,
Author anAuthor = new Author(......);
Book aBook = new Book("Java for dummy", anAuthor, 19.95, 1000);
// Use an anonymous instance of Author
Book anotherBook = new Book("more Java for dummy", new Author(......), 29.95, 888);*/
public class Book {
	private String name;
	private Author author;
	private double price;
	private int qtyInStock;
	
	public Book (String name, Author author, double price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.author = author;
		this.price = price;
		qtyInStock = 0;
	}
	
	public Book (String name, Author author, double price, int qtyInStock) {
		this.name = name;
		this.author = author;
		this.price = price;
		this.qtyInStock = qtyInStock;		
	}
		
	}
